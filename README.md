This repository contains the solutions to hash maps problems from the LeetCode DS and Algo course. Each problem solution is provided in JavaScript.

Hash maps, also known as hash tables or dictionaries, are efficient data structures that store and retrieve data using key-value pairs, allowing constant-time complexity for key-based operations. They use a hashing process to convert keys into numeric values and store corresponding values in an underlying array or bucket, offering flexibility and versatility for solving a wide range of problems.
